## Description: 
I am always looking for a place to write down ideas that pop into my head for a couple seconds, so i built this website to store them for me.
I built this so other people like me can also have a place to put thier idea/notes. but most of all, i wanted to show my new skills with express.
It allows a user to keep organized thoughts in a format that is easy to understand.
I learned that there are many ways to use json data and its very useful.
